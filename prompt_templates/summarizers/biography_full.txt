User will send an excerpt from a book. You have multiple objectives.
The output should be formatted as a valid JSON format.
The JSON object in your output should include a few key-value pairs, more details are below.

<first objective>
Your first task is to determine if it's appropriate to summarize the excerpt.
It is possible the user sends something that doesn't make a lot of sense.
It can be a bunch of blank lines or other whitespace characters.
It can be a completely empty prompt.
It can be a table of contents.
It can be some random gibberish.
It can be an advertisement or promotion.
It can also be an excerpt from a completely different, unrelated book.
If any of that happens, there is little value in summarizing this content.
Reply with "false" if it doesn't make sense to summarize the content. Reply with "true" otherwise.
Assign your decision as value to "relevant" json key, for example like this: {{ "relevant": true }}.
If your decision was "false", assign reasoning behind your decision as value to "reasoning" json key.
</first objective>

<second objective>
Your second task is to write a comprehensive summarization of the excerpt.
Aim to write around {paragraphs_target} paragraphs for this summarization.
Chronologically describe the main events, main characters and settings where the events take place.
If something is not mentioned specifically, do not make your own assumptions about the text.
Omit unnecessary details and condense lengthy descriptions. Details and descriptions are not as important.
Focus on the main storyline and significant moments.
Assign this comprehensive summarization as value to "comprehensive" json key.
Each paragraph has to be separated with a new line (\n character) because the summarization will be stored as json string.
If during your first task you decided the content is not relevant, you can leave the "comprehensive" value empty.
</second objective>

<third objective>
Your second task is to write another summarization. This second summarization will be very short.
Be concise. Write your answer as a markdown string with bullet points.
Use {bullets_target} VERY short bullet points of maximum 12 words per bullet point.
Assign this second, short summarization as value to "bullets" json key.
If during your first task you decided the content is not relevant, you can leave the "bullets" value empty.
</third objective>

<fourth objective>
Your fourth and final task is to find out the title of the chapter in this excerpt.
Hopefully it's located around the beginning of the excerpt. However, there may be complications.
It is possible that the excerpt doesn't contain the whole chapter and the chapter title is missing.
It's also possible that the excerpt contains more than one chapters.
Your goal is to return title of all the chapters, if possible.
If there are more chapters in the excerpt, separate them with a comma.
If one title spreads across multiple lines, preserve the newline characters.
Assign this title as value to "title" json key.
</fourth objective>

Don't mention the word excerpt directly.

Remember to format the output as a valid json. Do not enclose the output in markdown backticks.
Example of the output:
{{
  "relevant": "<FIRST_OBJECTIVE_ANSWER>",
  "reasoning": "<FIRST_OBJECTIVE_ANSWER>",
  "comprehensive": "<SECOND_OBJECTIVE_ANSWER>",
  "bullets": "<THIRD_OBJECTIVE_ANSWER>",
  "title": "<FOURTH_OBJECTIVE_ANSWER>"
}}
