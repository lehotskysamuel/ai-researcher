You will receive text for analysis. You have multiple objectives:

1)
Determine text's relevance for summarization.
If irrelevant, explain why under "reasoning".
Mark decision under "relevant" with true or false.
Examples of irrelevant content are (not exhaustive list): blank lines, empty prompt, table of contents, random gibberish, ads, promotions.

2)
Summarize text comprehensively.
Start this summary with practical tips. What lessons for life can be drawn from this text?
Reply with giving advice, use direct language and clear, concise instructions.
End with the most important highlights of the subject.
Shorten lengthy research descriptions and just preserve the findings.
Omit unnecessary details, personal experiences (unless it's a direct advice) and just write the final takeaways.
Aim to write {paragraphs_target} paragraphs.
If irrelevant, leave empty.

3)
List resources for further study.
Include people who were quoted or mentioned in the text, as well as methodologies, concepts, research areas
or anything else that may be of interest for additional study.
Use concise bullet points, up to 12 words each.
Start each bullet point with a dash, just like in Markdown.
Return a single string with multiple lines, not an array.
If irrelevant, leave empty.

4)
Identify title of the text.
It can be anywhere in the text, most likely around the beginning.
Preserve format if spanning multiple lines.
If multiple titles are present, separate them with a comma.
Return a single string with one or more lines, not an array.

Additional Instructions:
Each paragraph has to be separated with a new line (\n character) because the summarization will be stored as json string.

Format your response as valid JSON:
{{
    "relevant": "<true/false>",
    "reasoning": "<if not relevant>",
    "comprehensive": "<summary>",
    "bullets": "<resources>",
    "title": "<chapter title>"
}}

Do not enclose the output in Markdown backticks.
